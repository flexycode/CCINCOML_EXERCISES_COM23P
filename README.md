# ✍️Exercise

### Exercise 1

### 📊 Flowchart    

  🤝 1. The summer season is just months away. You are planning to go on a trip to cebu, bohol and davao for one week. Being a computer science/information technology student, you decided to create a travel itinerary by creating a flow chart.

### ⚡ Create a flow chart for your itinerary ⚡

 * ✍️ Your flow chart should use at least three decision symbols
 * ✍ Your flowchart should start in cebu, bohol and davao.

### 📊 Pseudocode 

✍️ 1. Create a pseudocode for the following java code below
<img src="odd even.png">

### 📊 Algorithm, flowchart and pseudocode

🤖 Think of an algorithm on how you will increase your chance of winning blackjack

* ✍️ Create a flowchart of you algorithm  
* ✍️ Write a pseudocode of your algorithm

```bash 
Kindly see the "blackjack_strategy_algorithm" text file for my overall analysis and explanation
